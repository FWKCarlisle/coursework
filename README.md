# coursework

Write a Python program relevant to your research:
* put course material into practice
* opportunity to become familiar with Python
* get feedback on your coding 
* requirement to qualify for credits

Your program should…
* be written as an importable module (.py file)
* do something meaningful: analyse real data or perform a simulation
* use at least two user functions
* use at least one of the modules introduced in Sessions 3 – 5
* produce at least one informative plot 
* comprise >~ 50 lines of actual code (excluding comments and imports)

Submit as source code (.py file) and pdf/png files of the output plot(s)
Ideally as GitHub repo.  I will also accept submissions via email (steven.bamford@nottingham.ac.uk)

Three stages:
* by 23 October
  *  README describing what you intend your code to do
  * Rough outline of the code (classes, functions, snippets, comments, pseudocode)
  * Feedback in a week
* by 6 November
  * Roughly working version of your code, although may be incomplete, have bugs, although try to make it reasonable and easy to understand!
  * Feedback in a week
* by 27 November
  * Full working version of your code (doesn’t have to be amazing – just work!)
  * Feedback and confirmation of pass by end of term
